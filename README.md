- Supports reading and writing RFID tags.
- Fully compatible with RFID MFRC522 modules and Nokia 5110 LCD displays.

## Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Mega, Nano).
- RFID module (e.g., MFRC522).
- Nokia 5110 LCD display.
- Button.
- USB cable for programming.
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RFIDCloner.io.git
    cd RFIDCloner.io
    ```

2. Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.

3. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.

4. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
